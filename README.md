# Bitwarden Auto-Backup Manager
A robust application that creates local, encrypted auto-backups for your Bitwarden vault.

## Requirements
Before installing the Bitwarden Auto-Backup Manager, you need to have the Bitwarden Desktop app installed locally on your device. You must ensure that the Bitwarden Desktop app is **not** installed through the Microsoft Store or the App Store.

If you have it downloaded through the Microsoft Store, click <a href='https://vault.bitwarden.com/download/?app=desktop&platform=windows'>here</a> to download the latest installer for the Bitwarden Desktop app. If you're running macOS, click <a href='https://vault.bitwarden.com/download/?app=desktop&platform=mac'>here</a> to download the darwin installer for the Bitwarden Desktop app.

At this time, we currently only support Windows operating systems, however we are working on a macOS release which should be available soon!
